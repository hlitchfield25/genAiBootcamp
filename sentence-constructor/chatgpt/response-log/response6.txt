Now, try forming the sentence using the vocabulary! Give it your best shot. 😊


Attempt1:犬は止まる吠える あなたは与える彼
Response:
Good try! Let's analyze what you wrote.  

### **Your sentence:**  
❌ **犬は止まる吠える あなたは与える彼**  

### **English translation of your sentence:**  
*"The dog stops and barks. You give him."*  

There are a few issues with verb forms and structure:  
1. **"犬は止まる吠える"**  
   - "止まる" (stop) should be in **negative form** to mean "won’t stop."  
   - "吠える" (bark) should be in **て-form** to connect with "止まる."  

2. **"あなたは与える彼"**  
   - "与える" (give) should be in **past tense** to match "Did you feed?"  
   - "彼" (him) needs a **particle** to show that he is the receiver of the action.  

---

### **Hints for Improvement:**  
1. **Fix the verb conjugations**  
   - "吠える" → **吠えて** (to link with "止まる")  
   - "止まる" → **止まらない** (won’t stop)  
   - "与える" → **与えた** (past tense for "did feed")  

2. **Add correct particles**  
   - 犬 **は** (marking topic)  
   - 彼 **に** (marking recipient)

Try again using these hints! You're getting closer. 💪😊

Attempt2: 犬は止まらない吠える あなたは与えた彼 に
Response:Good effort! You're almost there! Let's refine your sentence.

Your sentence:
❌ 犬は止まらない吠える あなたは与えた彼 に

English translation of your sentence:
"The dog won’t stop. Barks. You gave. Him to?"

There are two main issues:

"犬は止まらない吠える"

"吠える" (bark) should be in て-form to properly connect with "止まらない."
Correct form: "犬は吠えて止まらない。" (The dog won’t stop barking.)
"あなたは与えた彼 に"

The word order is incorrect in Japanese.
"彼" (him) should come before the verb "与えた" to match the correct Japanese sentence structure.
Correct form: "あなたは彼に与えたか？" (Did you feed him?)
Final Corrected Sentence:
✅ 犬は吠えて止まらない。あなたは彼に与えたか？
(The dog won’t stop barking. Did you feed him?)

Excellent progress! You're getting better with structure and conjugation. Want to try another sentence? 😊
