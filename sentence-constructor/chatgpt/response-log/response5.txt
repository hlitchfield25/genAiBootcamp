### **Possible Sentence Structure**  

1. **The dog would not stop barking.**  
   - **[Subject] + (Verb 1 in て-form) + (Verb 2 in negative form)**  
   - 犬 + (吠える in て-form) + (止まる in negative form)  

2. **Did you feed him?**  
   - **[Subject] + [Object] + (Verb in past tense) + か？**  
   - (あなた) + (彼に) + (与える in past tense) + か？

Now, try putting together a sentence using the vocabulary! Give it your best shot, and I'll help refine it. 😊


Attempt1:
犬しません止まる吠えるしたあなた与える彼

Response:
Good effort! Let's analyze what you wrote.  

Your sentence: **"犬しません止まる吠えるしたあなた与える彼"**  
### **English translation of your sentence:**  
*"The dog does not do. Stop. Bark. Did. You. Give. Him."*  

There are a few structural issues to fix:  
1. **犬しません** → "しません" is the negative form of "する" (to do), but "dog" is not an action, so this does not fit here.  
2. **止まる** → This is the dictionary form, but we need the **negative** form to say "won't stop."  
3. **吠えるした** → "した" is the past of "する" (to do), but "吠える" (bark) is its own verb, so it doesn't need "する."  
4. **与える彼** → Needs particles to make sense.  

---

### **Hints for Improvement:**  
- **"The dog would not stop barking"**  
  - "吠える" (bark) should be in **て-form** to connect actions.  
  - "止まる" (stop) should be in **negative form** to mean "won't stop."  
- **"Did you feed him?"**  
  - "与える" (feed) should be in **past tense** to match "Did."  
  - Particles are needed to show the object (him).  

Try again! You're getting closer. 💪😊


Attempt2:
犬吠える止まる あなた彼に与えるか

Response:
You're improving! Let's break down your attempt.  

Your sentence: **"犬吠える止まる あなた彼に与えるか"**  
### **English translation of your sentence:**  
*"Dog bark stop. You give him?"*  

### **Corrections & Suggestions:**  

1. **"犬吠える止まる" (Dog bark stop)**  
   - "吠える" (bark) should be in **て-form** to connect with "止まる" (stop).  
   - "止まる" should be in **negative form** to mean "won't stop."  

2. **"あなた彼に与えるか" (You give him?)**  
   - "与える" should be in **past tense** to match "Did you feed him?"  

---

### **Hints for Fixing:**  
1. **Make "barking" connect with "won't stop"**  
   - Use 吠える in て-form → **吠えて**  
   - Use 止まる in negative form → **止まらない**  

2. **Make "Did you feed him?" grammatically correct**  
   - Use 与える in past tense → **与えた**  
   - Particles are missing!  

Now, try one more time! You're really close. 😊


Attempt3: 
犬吠えて止まらない あなた彼に与えたか

Response:
Great job! Your sentence is very close to being correct!  

### **Your sentence:**  
✅ **犬吠えて止まらない あなた彼に与えたか**  

### **English translation:**  
*"The dog barks and won’t stop. You gave him?"*  

### **Minor Adjustments:**  
1. **"犬吠えて止まらない" → 犬** needs a **particle** for clarity.  
   - **犬は吠えて止まらない** ("As for the dog, it won’t stop barking.")  
   - "は" makes "犬" the **topic**, making the sentence sound more natural.  

2. **"あなた彼に与えたか"**  
   - "あなた" (you) is often omitted in casual speech, but if included, it needs a particle.  
   - **"あなたは彼に与えたか？"** (Did you give it to him?)  

### **Final Corrected Version:**  
✅ **犬は吠えて止まらない。あなたは彼に与えたか？**  
(*The dog won’t stop barking. Did you feed him?*)  

Awesome effort! You're picking up the structure well! 🎉💪 Want to try another sentence? 😊
