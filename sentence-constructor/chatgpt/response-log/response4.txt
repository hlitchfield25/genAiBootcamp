Now, try forming the sentence using the given vocabulary! Let me know what you come up with. 😊

Attempt:
	犬止まる	吠えるあなた彼に与えるか
Response:
Good try! Let's break it down and correct the structure.  

Your sentence: **"犬止まる 吠えるあなた彼に与えるか"**  
**English translation:** *"Dog stop bark you him give?"* (The structure and verb forms need adjustments.)  

### **Corrections & Explanation:**  
1. **Verb Conjugations:**  
   - "Stop" (止まる) should be in its **negative form** → **止まらない** (tomaranai).  
   - "Bark" (吠える) needs to be in **て-form** because it connects with another action → **吠えて** (hoete).  
   - "Feed" (与える) should be in **past tense** → **与えた** (ataeta).  

2. **Sentence Order:**  
   - Japanese follows **SOV (Subject-Object-Verb)** order, and particles are needed.  
   - "Did you feed him?" should be structured as **"You (subject) him (object) feed (past)?"**  

### **Correct Structure:**  
✅ **犬は吠えて止まらない。あなたは彼に与えたか？**  
*(The dog won't stop barking. Did you feed him?)*
