Now, let's break it down:

### Sentence Structure
- **The dog would not stop barking** – This part has the subject (the dog), the action (barking), and a description of it continuing and not stopping. Think about how to combine these actions.
- **Did you feed him?** – This is a yes/no question. It involves the verb for feeding and needs to be conjugated correctly for the question.

### Clues:
1. **"The dog"** – What particle would you use to mark the subject of the sentence? 
2. **"Would not stop barking"** – You need to use the verb for "bark" and combine it with a form of "continue" or "stop" in a negative form. What would the conjugation look like for this?
3. **"Did you feed him?"** – For the question part, use the verb for "feed" and turn it into a question. What ending would you add to make it a yes/no question?

Try to assemble the sentence based on these clues! Once you give it a shot, I can help you refine it.

Attempt:
	犬続ける吠えるあなたない餌をあげる彼
Response:
You're on the right track, but let's go through a few adjustments to help you!

### First, look at the sentence you gave:
**犬続ける吠えるあなたない餌をあげる彼**  
You have most of the components, but some small changes in order and conjugation are needed.

---

### Let's break it down:

1. **犬 (いぬ, *inu*)** – This is the dog, and you’re using it correctly as the subject of the sentence. But you need a particle to mark it as the subject of the sentence. Which particle should you use to indicate the subject of the sentence?
   
2. **続ける (つづける, *tsuzukeru*)** – This means "to continue." However, we need it in a form that fits with the negative aspect (not stop). You need to combine it with **吠える (ほえる, *hoeru*)** to create the idea of "barking continuously." Can you think of how to make this negative?

3. **あなた (あなた, *anata*)** – This is "you," but it’s often omitted in Japanese if it’s understood from the context. However, **あなた** can still be used to keep the sentence clear. It’s in the right place!

4. **餌をあげる (えさをあげる, *esa o ageru*)** – "To feed" is correct, but you need to change it to a question form. What ending would you add to make it a yes/no question?

---

### Putting it together:
1. First, figure out the correct subject particle after "犬" (Hint: it marks the subject).
2. Conjugate **続ける** to fit with the negative and use it with **吠える** for "would not stop barking."
3. For the question, add the correct question-ending form to **餌をあげる**.

Can you now try again and correct those points? Let me know how it goes!
